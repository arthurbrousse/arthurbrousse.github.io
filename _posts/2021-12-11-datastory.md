subtitle: Discover the analysis

Everyone not living in a cave for the whole twentieth century is a witness of global warming. Everyone knows that transportation of goods and of people is one of the causes of global warming, and is therefore a field with room for improvement. Naturally, technology is nowadays coming to the rescue, designing new cars that run on electricity, and not on conventional fuel. How efficient is this, and mostly, what effects does it have on people ? What does the population think of this new generation of vehicles, that seems to have gotten so much hype in the last decade ? 

To answer these questions, we have been provided with a dataset named [Quotebank](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf), which is _an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020._ This dataset will allow us to gather informations about what people have thought about the topic of electric cars versus thermic cars in a ten year span


# Introduction :
This story aims to present the evolution of the perception of plug-in eletric vehicles in the United States in the recent years, in a country that is well known for its relish of "conventional" internal combustion engine vehicles. 

Using these quotes, we will analyze what different groups of population think of this difference in the engines of their cars, how what they think is correlated with other factors such as their wealth, gender, geographic location, political orientation, ethnicity, and many others. We will pay particular attention to what makes people have a good opinion on plug-in electric vehicles, and what makes them have a bad opinion. We will conduct the analysis by studying mainly two main cases, namely the rise of Tesla Inc. since its creation in 2003, and the resilience in the car market shown by historical manufacturer such as Chevrolet. We will see what has happened during specific events, such as the release of the Tesla Model 3 (which is to this day the most sold plug-in eletric car in the world) in the summer of 2017, and other launches such as the one of the Chevrolet Silverado, which was the second most-sold car in the US in 2017. 



__Tesla__ : Tesla was founded in July 2003 as Tesla Motors, the name being in honor of Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company when he made an investment of 6.5 million USD in February 2004. He has served as CEO of the company since 2008.
