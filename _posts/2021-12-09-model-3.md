## How things stand for Tesla before the Model 3
TODO : State the general state of the quotes related to Tesla before the release (< 2017), make some comments. (basic stats / graphs)

**Inside inputs, outside inputs**


## The Tesla Model 3 and its release
The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than previous models by Tesla. Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017. The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took place on July 28. This is the day in which we focus our analysis.

**What it brings new, how it changes the market of electrical-powered automobiles**

## The aftermath
Since early 2020, the Model 3 is the best-selling electric car in world history, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to pass the 1 million global sales milestone.

## Everything that is below are helpers


Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
