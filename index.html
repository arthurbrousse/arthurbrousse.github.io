title: Plug-in electric vs internal combustion engine vehicles
subtitle: Analysis of the evolution of the perception of this duality in the US through quotes, from 2015 to 2020
---

This story aims to present the evolution of the perception of plug-in eletric vehicles in the United States in the recent years, in a country that is well known 
for its relish of "conventional" internal combustion engine vehicles. This study will be conducted with the help of the dataset "Quotebank", which is an 
agglomerate of quotes taken from newspapers. Each quote comes with a most likely speaker, attributed by an algorithm.

Using these quotes, we will analyze what different groups of population think of this difference in the engines of their cars, how what they think is correlated
with other factors such as their wealth, gender, geographic location, political orientation, ethnicity, and many others. We will pay particular attention to what 
makes people have a good opinion on plug-in electric vehicles, and what makes them have a bad opinion. We will conduct the analysis by studying mainly two main
cases, namely the rise of Tesla Inc. since its creation in 2003, and the resilience in the car market shown by historical manufacturer such as Chevrolet. 
We will see what has happened during specific events, such as the release of the Tesla Model 3 (which is to this day the most sold plug-in eletric car in the
world) in the summer of 2017, and other launches such as the one of the Chevrolet Silverado, which was the second most-sold car in the US in 2017. 


__Tesla__ : Tesla was founded in July 2003 as Tesla Motors, the name being in honor of Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company 
when he made an investment of 6.5 million USD in February 2004. He has served as CEO of the company since 2008.
